Awesome idea can be used for new projects as well. Have to ask Jari about his licensing first though...
Allrighty it's LGPL so as long as we contribute back our changes we're good to go ;). No problemo.

So here's how's it gonna go down: I want to use this for making a bootloader that allows firmware uploading => you have a single chip atmega328 for instance or an attiny running this sound protocol. With this bootloader you can connect it to arduino and program your chip without an expensive ftdi etc. Also you could make a kid friendly ide that runs on tablets and whatnot... Imagine the future of programming chips with smartphones and tablets through the audio jack! It will be bright ;)
